# TODO:

    - gotta add another module to configure a new player 
        -> that means I will have to change the way players
           are chosen so far. 
                 


# BUGS (known):
    - there is a bug with the Game.py:
        -> pokud se passnou invalid parametry, tak to crashne 
        -> I will willfully ignore this one, prostě to udělam tak, 
           že jim nedovolim to posrat.
